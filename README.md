For this challenge my role was:

As a senior data analyst at a company, I was given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. I was tasked by the executive team to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. The executive team also asked for a top-level summary of the study results.

I completed the challenge through Jupyter Notebook. Observe my dataframes, visuals and conclusions. Enjoy!
